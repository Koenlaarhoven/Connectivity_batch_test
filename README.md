# Connectivity_batch_test
I created a Python script to automatically test the SMCP and SSH connectivity to a list of IP's. The script was build to verify connectivity of Cisco ACI nodes within the fabric after a configuration change through the APIC. The script makes use of Python classes and displays a colored output for clarity. Names and IP's have been anonimized.
